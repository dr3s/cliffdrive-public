### Adam Schieber - Treasurer ###
A prolific procreator with 4 kids in 5 years (and more to come!), Adam’s goal is to have 
all of Kansas City see Kessler Park as their recreational playground for extreme outdoor 
activities. From rock climbing, to mountain biking, pump tracks to disc golf, there 
should be something for everyone in the whole family available. If you have an idea for 
something you would like to see in a park but don’t think anyone would go along with 
your crazy idea, shoot Adam an email. He will. He loves crazy.
