### Hiking ###
Near the east entrance to Cliff Drive (just west of the intersection of Van Brunt and 
Gladstone Boulevards), a well established but primitive trail runs along the steep 
slope which parallels Gladstone Boulevard. The trail travels through a forest of 
large maples and passes a half-dozen springs issuing from the hillside.
