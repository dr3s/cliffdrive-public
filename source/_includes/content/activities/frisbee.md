### Frisbee ###
The course plays around the old municipal reservoir and is one of the highest points in 
the city. Featuring a mix of long open shots and technical woods(#7-11), this course 
will take its toll on both your body and your score. Plenty of wind and great views of 
the city add to the fun. Bring water and a some good footwear for the woods.
