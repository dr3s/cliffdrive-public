Natural wonders of the drive include limestone bluffs next to steep forested slopes 
descending to the industrial Missouri River bottoms. A small portion of high quality 
forest lies between Cliff Drive and Chestnut Trafficway where large trees tower over 
ferns, wild ginger, Soloman's seal, dogtooth violet, and many varieties of wildflowers.
