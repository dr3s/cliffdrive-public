Situated within historic Kessler Park, established in 1895, the long, linear park 
stretches from roughly Paseo on the west to Chouteau traffic way on the east. 
The design and planning effort of the park and byway were an integral part of the 
evolution and development of Kansas City as a major metropolitan area.
